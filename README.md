# HUM403 Final Project

This project is an E-Lit poem for my HUM 403 class at NJIT. It uses a face
detection library to "hide" a poem from you when you look at it. The face 
detection library & machine learning models were obtained from (face-api.js)[https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js]
